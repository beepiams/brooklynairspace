        bio: Randy is a (hula) hooper, custom hoop crafter and fire performer. He earned his degree from UC Berkeley in a completely unrelated field. Randy has performed with the hoop in music videos, at numerous events and festivals, and in The BEX's productions of "HELLO!" and "HELLO!100." He has performed internationally with fire, including with the Burning Man Fire Conclave. Randy's obsession with the hoop naturally led him to the "big hoop" or Cyr Wheel. The wheel mesmerized him from the moment he first saw a video of it online. After many months of fruitless searching for instruction or information in New York City, he ordered a wheel from Montreal and began the long arduous journey of teaching himself. He has performed with The Lost Circus, the CBS Morning Show, Lola Star's Dreamland Roller Disco, and more at venues including The Queens Theatre, The Irondale Center, Dixon Place and The House of Yes. He has taught at Streb, Circus Warehouse, and Kazuko Hirabayashi Dance Theater.

        bio: Amanda Archuleta has been dancing since a very young age, beginning with classical ballet and contemporary and later shifting to partner dancing. She learned Swing, Salsa, Bachata, and many other ballroom dances, eventually leading her to Argentine Tango, and to the city of Buenos Aires for further study. She has studied under many greats, with her major influence coming from Fabian Peralta, Virgina Pandolfi, Horacio Godoy, and most recently, expanding her diversity of style and technique with Jay Abling, Robin Thomas, and Ney Melo. Amanda has a deep appreciation of the relationship between health and movement, so after moving to New York City to continue her own progression as a teacher and performer, she searched for a restorative class to help her own body recover from the intensity of dance and discovered the healing power of GYROKINESIS®, which resulted in a noticeable impact and transformation in her dancing. With a focus on core and an emphasis on breath, Gyro teaches proper fundamentals of movement, resulting in strength and flexibility of both the muscles and spine. She has also seen significant practical application for non-dancers including athletes, elderly, people with injuries, and anyone who wants to improve the movement of their bodies. Amanda studied directly with Juliu Horvath, creator of the GYROTONIC EXPANSION SYSTEM®. She embraces the philosophy that a good teacher never stops learning and enjoys the process of bettering herself as a dancer as well as a teacher.

        bio: Starting on the ground with Lou Reed, Laurie Anderson, and Ornette Coleman at Lincoln Center "?Civiliazation", Amanda evolved into a NYC-based aerialist travelling the globe to perform at unlikely events such as aerial bungee for the Turkish Pop-Star Tarkan in Baku Azerbaijan on a New Year’s eve. Now, Amanda works closely with companies and curators to create unique aerial performances. In 2005, Amanda lost 75% of her hearing and was forced to have surgery to recover it. Through extensive training and perseverance she gradually overcame the vertigo that followed to acquire new directional skills and equilibrium in the air. For four years Amanda taught Aerial Fitness at Barnard College. Training certifications include Pilates Mat and Machine from Kane Pilates (now Kinected) NYC, Kettlebells, TRX, and Pre and Post Natal training. Recent creations include an aerial fabric installation for Cedar Lake Dance, an aerial collaboration with Larry Keigwin Dance Company for "Keigwin Cabaret", and work with sculptor Marianne Vitale to create an aerial component to fill vertical space in an installation for Performa. Amanda worked as Creative Director and Choreographer for the film "Fundipendulous", and with clothing designer Victoria Bartlett of VPL, creating a piece featuring  aerial performance from man-made structures in nature.  Her corporate work includes two years of The Genius Gala at the Liberty Science Center, a cube act to honor Erno Rubik, a crescent moon number honoring Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactic and Buzz Aldrin, and aerial silks to accompany opera singer Denyce Graves signature aria "Habenera" at the Kennedy Center in Washington, DC. Amanda draws inspiration from learning about the people for whom she creates, and especially the beauty of the ceilings where she hangs.

        bio: Miriam Wasmund is a New York City based choreographer, dancer and Personal Trainer. She has been exploring and loving movement since childhood. This love lead her to NYC at age 18 to study with Alvin Ailey Dance Theatre as a conservatory student. Miriam has danced for and trained with Gus Giordano, Joel Hall, the Kirby Reed Project, River North's Frank Chavez, Janna Hicks, Val Suarez and Colette Brandenburg, amongst others. Miriam founded collaborative Theatre and Dance company, The Impulse Initiative, which has performed as part of the NYC Fringe Festival, at the Nuyorican Poets Cafe, Triskelion Arts, Wax Works, The Actors Fund, and The Bank Street Theatre (as it's last show before closing) to name a few. With the natural ebb and flow that comes with being a performer and an adventurous spirit, Miriam furthered her love of movement in 2010 by taking on the professional world of fitness, health and wellness after she rode her bike 1100 miles in 3 weeks down the pacific coast. A Personal Trainer since 2010, Miriam works for the industry leading gym, Equinox, and as the Official trainer for Mudderella, an obstacle course mud run designed to inspire women to greater confidence by owning their strength and abilities. Marathoner, obstacle course racer, cyclist, and one for physical adventure and challenge as well a constant pursuit of education of the body and how it moves, adapts, and transforms, she continues to try new things to expand her ability to grow and teach. Miriam has been studying the aerial and pole art form for some time now, and finds great joy from being able to combine her love of strength work and dance lines with an enduring and open spirit. She is excited to bring her passion for teaching people to find movement that leads them to live and be present in their bodies and to inspire individuals to find strength, creativity and wellness as a practice for everyday happiness to the Brooklyn AirSpace team.
